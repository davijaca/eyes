<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About


This is a single page html application on the Moving Eyes Exercise from the MIT xPro course.

The exercise is about how to create and animate HTML components that will follow the mouse cursor around the screen, and style it with CSS to look like eyes.

As part of a personal preference and desire to further improve the exercise, I added the picture of the iris to the eye ball components as a form of extra practice.
